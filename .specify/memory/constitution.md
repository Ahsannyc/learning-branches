# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Focus
The project must prioritize teaching embodied intelligence and physical AI principles. All content and implementations must align with the core goal of bridging the gap between digital AI and physical robotics systems, emphasizing ROS 2, Gazebo simulation, NVIDIA Isaac platform, and Vision-Language-Action integration.

### Docusaurus Book Development
The textbook must be built using Docusaurus and deployed to GitHub Pages. All content structure, styling, and deployment processes must follow Docusaurus best practices and maintain professional quality standards suitable for technical education.

### RAG Chatbot Integration
The textbook must include an integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that can answer user questions based on book content. The chatbot must utilize modern AI technologies and provide accurate, context-aware responses to enhance the learning experience.

### Claude Code & Spec-Kit Plus Driven Development
All development must follow Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus. This includes creating proper specifications, plans, and task breakdowns before implementation, ensuring systematic and well-documented development.

### OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs with Supporting Technologies
The RAG system must utilize OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs along with FastAPI, Neon Serverless Postgres database, and Qdrant Cloud Free Tier for vector storage. Implementation must follow best practices for these technologies and maintain scalability and performance.

### Personalization & Localization Features
The textbook must support user personalization features including background-based content adaptation and Urdu language translation. These features should enhance accessibility and provide tailored learning experiences for diverse user backgrounds.

## Technical Requirements
<!-- Additional Constraints, Security Requirements, Performance Standards, etc. -->

All implementations must use modern web technologies and follow security best practices. The application must be deployable to GitHub Pages with the RAG chatbot backend running on appropriate cloud infrastructure. Performance considerations must account for real-time AI interactions and database queries.

## Development Workflow
<!-- Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->

Development must follow the Spec-Kit Plus methodology with proper specification, planning, and task breakdown. All code must be reviewed before merging, and automated tests must pass. The project must include comprehensive documentation and a demo video under 90 seconds for evaluation.

## Governance

The constitution governs all aspects of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook development. All contributions must align with these principles. Amendments require documentation of changes and approval from project maintainers. Development must follow the timeline specified in the hackathon requirements with submission by Sunday, Nov 30, 2025.
