# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Hackathon. This textbook will guide you through the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence, preparing you for the exciting journey ahead.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with the physical world. Unlike traditional digital AI systems that operate in virtual environments, Physical AI systems interact directly with the physical environment through robots, sensors, and actuators.

## The Journey Ahead

This hackathon will take you through a comprehensive exploration of Physical AI, from fundamental concepts to advanced architectural patterns. You'll learn about:

- Embodied Intelligence and its principles
- ROS 2 as the robotic nervous system
- Digital Twins and simulation environments
- NVIDIA Isaac as AI robot brains
- Vision-Language-Action systems integration

## Getting Started

As you begin this journey, remember that Physical AI is about bridging the gap between digital intelligence and physical reality. The concepts you'll learn form the foundation for creating AI systems that can operate effectively in human-centered environments.
