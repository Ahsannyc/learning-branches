# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Hackathon Phase-1 Frontend Content

## User Prompt

```
You are working inside a Spec-Kit-Plus FRONTEND textbook project for the
Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Hackathon.

This task is STRICTLY FRONTEND-ONLY and limited to Step-1 of the hackathon.

🔒 HARD CONSTRAINTS (ABSOLUTE)

Frontend-only scope

Operate only inside the Docusaurus frontend

Use Markdown / MDX content pages only

❌ No backend folders

❌ No APIs

❌ No FastAPI, Node, Python, databases, agents, or tools

Follow structure.md exactly

Phase naming

Folder layout

Page organization

Follow hackathon.md exactly

Perform Step-1 only

No partial or future steps

Create ONLY Phase-1

❌ No Phase-0

❌ No Phase-2+

❌ No placeholders or TODOs for later phases

Do NOT implement or scaffold

Chatbot

RAG

Authentication

Personalization

Translation

UI theming beyond default Docusaurus

Any bonus features

Do NOT reference future phases

Phase-1 must read as a complete, standalone foundation

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Execute Step-1 from hackathon.md by creating Phase-1 FRONTEND CONTENT ONLY, using Docusaurus-compatible Markdown, strictly aligned with:

structure.md

hackathon.md

Hackathon PDF pages 3–9

📘 REQUIRED SOURCE MATERIAL (MANDATORY)

You must read and synthesize Hackathon PDF pages 3–9 and integrate their material into frontend book pages only.

Pages 3–9 content to include (frontend narrative only):

## Response Summary

Created comprehensive feature specification for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Hackathon Phase-1 Frontend Content. The specification includes:

- User scenarios for accessing Physical AI introduction content, understanding course learning outcomes, and learning about conceptual hardware architecture
- 15 functional requirements covering all aspects of Phase-1 frontend content
- Key entities including Phase-1 Content Pages, Physical AI Concepts, Course Structure, Technical Architecture Concepts, and Student Learning Path
- 5 measurable success criteria with specific metrics
- Edge cases for different student backgrounds and reading patterns

The specification adheres to all constraints including frontend-only scope, following structure.md and hackathon.md exactly, and focusing only on Step-1 requirements. A validation checklist was also created and all items were marked as completed, confirming the specification is ready for the planning phase.

## Outcome

Specification successfully created and validated, ready for planning phase. The branch `001-physical-ai-hackathon` contains the complete spec file at `specs/001-physical-ai-hackathon/spec.md`.
